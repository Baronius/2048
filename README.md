# 2048 Versus
A small clone of [2048](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048), to add a multiplayer component and to eliminate randomness.  Unlike the original game where a new tile enters the field at a random position after a move, this version requires a second player to click where they would like the new tile to be placed, hopefully at a place that will make subsequent moves difficult for the first player.
